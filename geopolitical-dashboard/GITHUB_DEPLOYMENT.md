# GitHub Deployment Guide

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Quick Start - Push to GitHub in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `geopolitical-dashboard`
   - **Description**: `Interactive geopolitical analysis dashboard with 8 charts`
   - **Public** (so it can be deployed)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/ak/geopolitical-dashboard

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/geopolitical-dashboard.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

### Step 3: Verify on GitHub

1. Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/geopolitical-dashboard`
2. You should see all your files!
3. Check that the README.md displays correctly

## üîë Important Notes

- **Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`** with your actual GitHub username
- **Make sure the repository is PUBLIC** for Plotly Cloud to access it
